# Graduation Internship ViriCiti
## Week 2
### What did I do?
The week started off with iterating over the clickable prototype. I asked the customer service department to inquire about what the customers wanted in the new app. What do they use our system the most for and would they like to see in the app. Breytner, one of the companies that use the system, replied with an extensive wish list. I've used this feedback to iterate over the prototype adding multiple new features like vehicle state and seeing where all the fleets are on the map.

After that I called a meeting with most of the developers. I wanted to discuss the handling of authentication and data requesting. Since a lot of services need to be connect to each other to make everything work I thought this was important. We were able to make a plan which everyone agreed on by doing this. It was a productive meeting where everybody could share their thoughts and expertise.

The rest of the week I build the entire front-end for the dashboard part of the native app. This went really quick, really really quick. This is mainly due to the experience I've gathered in the past two years. I've build all the components in a re-usable way so the codebase stays maintainable and extensible. I also made sure I build all the elements based on a configuration file. This way, all parts are easily changed by changing a parameter in the configuration. This allows for a maintainable and extensible application as well.

After I build all the pages of the dashboard I hooked up the real fleets and vehicles to the app. The dashboard is now ready for the final step. This step is to hook up real-time and historical data. A nice addition is the API class and Local Storage class I've written. This ensures that all the logic is in a separate re-usable file. This keeps the codebase neat and DRY.

### For who/what did I do this?
I iterated over the original prototype to implement user wishes in the app. It makes sense to first make this in a prototype so I wasn't distracted by technical boundaries. It was also nice to spark the conversation with this prototype.

I called the meeting to discuss and agree on the authentication and data requesting in an early stage. This way everyone knows when they need to do their part and what is needed.

In my original planning I wanted to first have all the data present and then start with the building of components. Since I have to work with other developers who are not ready for that yet I decided to start with this. I can build all components with mock data. This speeds up the process of the project and allows for early user testing.

I hooked up the real fleets and vehicles to the app because after this is done we can do proper user testing per company with their own data. It also brought up the first performance issues which I otherwise wouldn't have encountered until a later stage. I was able to fix this fairly easy now.

### What went well/not so well?
The second week went really well! I was able to do a lot of work in an orderly and structured fashion. I was able to show a pro-active attitude which was greatly appreciated. My internship supervisor, Simon Rijk, was impressed by what and how I build it. He also liked that I inquired for user input at real companies. I want to keep this up throughout the internship.

## Week 1
### What did I do?
The week started off with some more explanation about the project I was going to do. After that I started with idea generation. I sketched a few idea's to spark the conversation. After that I got feedback on the idea's. With this feedback I started building and designing a clickable prototype which we can test with users. Throughout this process I received feedback for improvements.

I've also spend a good few days diving into React Native, the framework we are going to use in order to build an Android and IOS app with my skills in React. I researched some development environments and quickly came across Expo.io. With the development environment running I started researching React Native. I build a few components to check if I understood everything.

Near the end of the week I started the main project. I researched and build tab-navigation and stack-navigation in order to be able to click through all the screens I was going to build. This was a challenge, but really useful to get out the way at the start of the project.

Finally, I setup a planning for this project. I used Asana as the tool to do this. I build main tasks with subtasks for most of the project. The earlier on in the project, the more detailed the tasks are. This way I could see what's needed to build this app. By continuously keeping track of progress and results here, ViriCiti can see how the project is coming along.

### For who/what did I do this?
I build the prototype mostly for testing our idea's with the users that are going to be using the app. Since this is a new project, it was also great for opening up discussions on what the app should do in detail.

I dove into React Native mostly for myself. I wanted to get my development environment and first small app up an running in the first week so I would be able to make a good planning based on how long it would take me to build.

I setup the project planning in Asana for ViriCiti and myself to give some guidance throughout the project. The ViriCiti team and I now also know at which stage of the project several people will have to jump in to make the functionality happen (e.g. modification of current API).

### What went well/not so well?
The first went really well! I got to know the project and what is needed. I was able to visualize idea's from ViriCiti and myself in the form of an hi-fi clickable prototype. Understanding React Native went even better. I am experienced in React so there wasn't a steep learning curve. Later on in the projects, for instance with building notification functionality, I might have some more trouble.

This went so well because this isn't new to me. I learned the core of Javascript during the minor webdevelopment. This helps me to quickly learn new frameworks. Designing and building a clickable prototype wasn't new to me either since we learned this throughout the study. I was able to put the skills I learned during CMD in to practice.

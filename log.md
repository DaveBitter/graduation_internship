# Graduation Internship ViriCiti
## Week 1
### What did I do?
The week started off with some more explanation about the project I was going to do. After that I started with idea generation. I sketched a few idea's to spark the conversation. After that I got feedback on the idea's. With this feedback I started building and designing a clickable prototype which we can test with users. Throughout this process I received feedback for improvements.

I've also spend a good few days diving into React Native, the framework we are going to use in order to build an Android and IOS app with my skills in React. I researched some development environments and quickly came across Expo.io. With the development environment running I started researching React Native. I build a few components to check if I understood everything.

Near the end of the week I started the main project. I researched and build tab-navigation and stack-navigation in order to be able to click through all the screens I was going to build. This was a challenge, but really useful to get out the way at the start of the project.

Finally, I setup a planning for this project. I used Asana as the tool to do this. I build main tasks with subtasks for most of the project. The earlier on in the project, the more detailed the tasks are. This way I could see what's needed to build this app. By continuously keeping track of progress and results here, ViriCiti can see how the project is coming along.

### For who/what did I do this?
I build the prototype mostly for testing our idea's with the users that are going to be using the app. Since this is a new project, it was also great for opening up discussions on what the app should do in detail.

I dove into React Native mostly for myself. I wanted to get my development environment and first small app up an running in the first week so I would be able to make a good planning based on how long it would take me to build.

I setup the project planning in Asana for ViriCiti and myself to give some guidance throughout the project. The ViriCiti team and I now also know at which stage of the project several people will have to jump in to make the functionality happen (e.g. modification of current API).

### What went well/not so well?
The first went really well! I got to know the project and what is needed. I was able to visualize idea's from ViriCiti and myself in the form of an hi-fi clickable prototype. Understanding React Native went even better. I am experienced in React so there wasn't a steep learning curve. Later on in the projects, for instance with building notification functionality, I might have some more trouble.

This went so well because this isn't new to me. I learned the core of Javascript during the minor webdevelopment. This helps me to quickly learn new frameworks. Designing and building a clickable prototype wasn't new to me either since we learned this throughout the study. I was able to put the skills I learned during CMD in to practice.

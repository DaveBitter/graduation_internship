# User inquiries ViriCiti Mobile app
## The goal
The goal of this inquiry is to validate our idea's and gain new perspective and idea's from the customers point of view. We would like to know how we can make an Mobile app that will be perfectly in line with the customers needs and wishes. Although we can't implement every wish for every customer, we would still like to know what different companies want so we can make a well educated decision on design choices for the Mobile app.

The following "Questionair" is made to guide the conversation in order not to have a question/answer conversation. We would like the customer to engage in a fruitful exchange of idea's and wishes. The question form the core of what we would like to know, but there is always room for other questions if the conversation leads to it.

We will record the conversation for archiving purposes and to keep a natural conversation going. Nothing bogs down a conversation more than a person having to write everything done all the time. We will ask for permission first of course. We will make a short summary of the recordings to read back during iterating the design for the Mobile app.

It would be nice if we could come back in the future to show the customer what we made based on their feedback and to iterate the Mobile app again with their new feedback. We preferably make a connection with the company for these kind of meetings to be held more often in the feature.

# End Report Graduation Internship ViriCiti

## Prelude

I did my internship during my final year at ViriCiti. ViriCiti provides a monitoring solution for electric buses all
around the world.

I wanted to do my internship at ViriCiti because of the worldwide scale on which ViriCiti operates. It is a great change to do a project on this scale. The product makes me enthousiastic aswell. Doing an internship which is related to the internet of things is an amazing chance to get.

I came across ViriCiti because I did my previous internship at Cohere, which, falls together with ViriCiti and Livetech under Transitions Now. I worked, while studying, for the past year and a half at ViriCiti. I really enjoy working here, since and the projects are perfect for Communication and Multimedia design students at the HvA.

During the internship I got to learn a completely new skill. I got the chance to learn native development, in the form of an Android and an iOS app, during the internship. This is a skill I always wanted to learn. At ViriCiti I got the chance to learn this and create an incredible real-time monitoring app!

## The company

As I previously mentioned, ViriCiti provides a monitoring solution for electric buses all around the world. By giving insights about for range and
performance for instance, operators can act. This will reduce
range anxiety, the fear that the battery will run out before the
route ends, and therefore help companies drive electric. The
data comes in via the small computer inside the buses called
the ‘datahub’. ViriCiti develops these ‘datahubs’ in house.

ViriCiti promises a 10% higher uptime, a 25% increase in range
and a 100% transparency of your data. Therefore companies
around the world use this system.

### The office

ViriCiti has around 20 employees. All departments work in the
same space. This allows for an open office culture. There is a
direct line between customer calls to feedback for developers.
ViriCiti also provides space to learn. A few interns currently
work here aswell as a few former interns.

### The products

ViriCiti's main product is the web application which let users view all of the live and historical data right in the browser. If an electric bus or truck can send out a paramater, a piece of data, ViriCiti will make sure you can view this live, perform analysis and generate reports on it.

ViriCiti also provides incident notifications through email and sms. A user can receive a notification when for instance a bus or truck has a low battery. This will help users keep track of their fleets.

ViriCiti has countless other, smaller, products to make sure this runs a smoothly as possible.

### My position within the company.

I am mainly the front-end developer at ViriCiti. I'm in charge of realising all the ideas for the front-end. I do have more than one role at ViriCiti because of it's smaller size. There is no visual or user experience design department. This is no problem because I can take on these roles because of my studies. During this internship I will also be in charge of native development. This is a lot of responsability that I'm more than willing to take on.

## The internship supervisor

I had two people supervising my internship. Simon Rijk supervised my internship for the general part while Sakif Surur supervised me with day to day stuff.

### Simon Rijk

Simon Rijk, my internship supervisor, is an Aerospace engineer
and ICT specialist from the Technical University of Delft. He
is one of the founders of ViriCiti and has been working in this
field for several years. Because of his years of experience in
IoT and programming he is able to provide guidance in finding
the right solutions for complex problems in programming.

He makes sure that the quality of the products and solutions are of a great standerd and will lead all major projects.

### Sakif Surur

Sakif Surur, developer at ViriCiti, is Web Developer from the
University of Amsterdam. He will help me with day-to-day
guidance. With his years of experience in web- and appdevelopment
he will be able to help me in the area of frontend
and app-development since the main assignment of the
internship is bulding a native app.

Sakif is involved in every project and will use his skills and knowledge to realize them and to optimize them.

## My job description

During the internship I took on four major roles. I had a lot of freedom and responsibility during this project. I worked very autonomous.

### Front-end/Native developer

I was in charge of building the actual app. For this I needed to use a popular Javascript front-end framework that is used to create native apps, React Native, to realize this. I was in charge of writing all the code to build the functionality and styles of the app.

### User Experience/Visual designer

I also was in charge of all the design work. I needed to sketch all the ideas to a low-fi prototype, design a hi-fi prototype and iterate over the user experience and visual design throughout the entire process of building the app.

### Back-end developer

I needed to build an server to hook my app up to and handle all the requests. To do this, I had to write an API to make requests to. This server would then make sure to get everything you requested. I also had to write some microservices to provide functionality. More on this later.

### Project manager

I managed this project all on my own. It was my responsibilty to make sure that the project was on track and everything was done in a structured and documented way.

## Internship activities

During my internship I did an immense amount of work within multiple roles. Below, I will descrive all the activities from the initial meeting to the finished app and what roles I took on during the process.

### Initial meeting

During the initial meeting we discussed what the app should do in general. I got to find out what I needed to sketch and design. I had the meeting with Freek Dielissen, CEO, and Alexander Schabert, Head of Sales and Simon Rijk, CTO. During this meeting I found out that ViriCiti wanted an app that showed real time data, showed historical data and receives notifications if an incident triggers. In the core, this is what the app should be able to do.

Besides this, there was no initial sketch or design for the app. I was in charge of coming app with how this app should look and, more importantly, how the app should work. In order to do this as well as possible I started sketched to get all my first ideas out there. With these sketches I could validate my assumptions and iterate before creating the actual design and hi-fi prototype.

After I sketched the fist few ideas I called another meeting with Freek Dielissen and Alexander Schabert. The liked the ideas I had but wanted to gear the app for the first version more towards to the dispatcher and less to the maintenance workers. I took their feedback and iterated over the sketches.

### Setting up project and Asana

I setup a brand new project and a new project on Asana, a Trello like todo list app that ViriCiti uses. This gave me a global planning and let my internship supervisors keep track on the state of the project. I also used this as a sort of log on what I did for future reference.

### The design

#### First sketches

[IMAGE1][image2]

In image 1 and 2 you can see the results of the initial sketches. I sketched the rough ideas for the interface, what to display and how to navigate. I worked on these sketches to get a green light to turn these into actual visual designs. I got the green light and used these sketches to create the first hi-fi prototype.

#### First design

[IMAGE3][image4]

I used Adobe Experience Design to create all the designs and link them together to create a first hi-fi prototype. I went more in dept into all the elements in the user interface. In image 3 and 4 you can see the results of this work. With this hi-fi prototype I was able to get more feedback from Freek Dielissen, Alexander Schabert, Simon Rijk and Sakif Surur. I took all this feedback to iterate over the design

#### Iterating over design

[IMAGE5][image6]

In images 5 and 6 you can see the updated designs. I updated minor stuff and now had a good idea of how the app was going to look like and work. This was an prototype I could use to test with users.

#### User feedback/Interviews

I wanted to test the hi-fi prototype with the actual users. Because of this I setup an meeting with two customers of ViriCiti. The first was Qbuzz, the public transport company in Utrecht. The second one was Breytner, a transport company in Rotterdam. I started of with making a plan for these interviews. I wrote down what I wanted to get to know. This gave me a bit of guidance in the interviews.

The first interview with Qbuzz was very informative, but not for the prototype I made. I did'nt had the meeting with the actual dispatchers due to inavailability. I still managed to get information by steering the interview into a different direction. We discussed functionality for a different end user which we may want to focus on in the future. We discussed what we could provide for the drivers. I took note of all the ideas for future reference.

The second interview with Breytner was really useful. During the initial designs I inquired with Breytner about what they wanted to see in the app. With this information in mind I made the first few designs.

Breytner is a company with four electric transport trucks. They don't look as much on a daily basis to a lot of data or reports. They're main concern is that the trucks charge overnight. If a truck doesn't charge (correctly) overnight they have a serious problem.

I discussed what we could add in the app to provide them with the information they needed in the easiest way possible. At the moment, you can see if a vehicle is charging. I assumed that that was enough. It turns out that that isn't enough. They usually look up the graph of the battery charging. This way they can see if there is a sudden drop in charging rate. This sometimes happens due to faulty charging cables. When this happens and they don't notice it they can get into trouble. They're trucks need to be charged because of the small size of their fleet. Two not fully charged trucks can cause serious problems. Because of this I want to implement the graph in the app. Currently the gauges with speed and state of charge are shown on the vehicle page. This doesn't make sense when the vehicle is charging. The speed will always be 0 and the soc will go up slowly. I want to take a look at showing the graph instead when the vehicle is charging. It's a small change, with a lot of impact.

This discussion led to the other part of the app. They can setup notifications if their trucks aren't charging withing a range of time. They explained that the trucks get connected to the charger at around 8 p.m. and need to be charged the next morning. By creating a notification for this and receiving it on the native app we can help them prevent this issue. It would be very useful if they get a notification that charging is not going as it should. When they click on the notification they should immediately see how the truck has been charging.

It turned out that Breytner needed this feature, but never knew ViriCiti already does this with emails and sms. It is a feature the user wants but doesn't find easily in the portal. Because of this I want to let users setup a notification in the app. This will be a more in your face approach to getting users to make use of this feature.

#### Iterating over design

I took all the feedback and topics discussed during the interviews in to account while creating an iteration on the design for the app. The app will be more useful for the user with these modifications.

### Learning React Native

I then started to learn React Native. React Native is a framework that allows you to create a native app for Android and iOS with Javascript. This is a logical choice because ViriCiti works with Javascript and React for the web applications and so have I have aswell for the past year and a half.

Because of this, the learing curve wasn't very steep. React Native is basically React without a stylesheet and HTML. I was pretty quick to pick React Native up. Within the week I made my first couple of screens to try stuff out.

#### Expo.io

I decided to use Expo.io as the development environment. Expo.io allowed me to create compile an iOS build on Linux. Therefor, I every developer at ViriCiti can easily help in the project if they need to. It also handles all the compiling for you. This can be a pain in the butt so using this relieves that.

Expo.io also sets you up with native functionalities that you will likely need. Push notifications is a good example of this. It is incredibly easy to set this up for Android and iOS.

### Building first screens

With Expo.io setup and a good hi-fi prototype I could finally get started with building the app. I decided to build to parts of the app before even beginning to think about getting data in there. These two parts were navigation and components.

#### Navigation

I decided to start with navigation. The app needs to be able to navigate to all the screens that it needs to. I decided on using an industry standerd called React Navigation. React Navigation offers me with all the functionality I needed. I build four stacks, a collection of screens in an order, for the app. The first stack was the dashboard stack. This stack was for all the screens of the monitoring part. The second stack was the search stack. This stack was for searching and viewing fleets and vehicles. The third stack was the notification stack for viewing notifications. The final stack was the settings stack with all the user settings.

After setting this up I was ready to build the first few screens with the components that it needs.

#### Components

[IMAGE7][image8][IMAGE9]

I decided to focus on the dashboard part of the app first. The dashboard screens consist of three major components. The three components, the Map, the charts and the lists, in image 7, 8 and 9.

##### The map

The map component was fairly easy to build. I decided to use the most used and supported package React Native Maps by Airbnb. This package is by far the most documented, active and supported. It also provides all the functionality I needed it to. With this package I was able to create the map component very quickly.

##### The charts

For the charts I decided to use Victory Charts. Like React Native Maps this package provided me with all the functionality I needed. It was incredibly easy to build the chart components with this.

##### The list

The final major component I build was the listcomponent. I had to make this component myself. I made a componetnt that will show the user different views while viewing fleets or vehicles. The list items all show real time data to the user. Building this component took some time, but was pretty easy to do.

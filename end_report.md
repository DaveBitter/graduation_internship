# End Report Graduation Internship ViriCiti

## Prelude

I did my internship during my final year at ViriCiti. ViriCiti provides a monitoring solution for electric buses all
around the world.

I wanted to do my internship at ViriCiti because of the worldwide scale on which ViriCiti operates. It is a great change to do a project on this scale. The product makes me enthousiastic aswell. Doing an internship which is related to the internet of things is an amazing chance to get.

I came across ViriCiti because I did my previous internship at Cohere, which, falls together with ViriCiti and Livetech under Transitions Now. I worked, while studying, for the past year and a half at ViriCiti. I really enjoy working here, since and the projects are perfect for Communication and Multimedia design students at the HvA.

During the internship I got to learn a completely new skill. I got the chance to learn native development, in the form of an Android and an iOS app, during the internship. This is a skill I always wanted to learn. At ViriCiti I got the chance to learn this and create an incredible real-time monitoring app!

## The company

As I previously mentioned, ViriCiti provides a monitoring solution for electric buses all around the world. By giving insights about for range and
performance for instance, operators can act. This will reduce
range anxiety, the fear that the battery will run out before the
route ends, and therefore help companies drive electric. The
data comes in via the small computer inside the buses called
the ‘datahub’. ViriCiti develops these ‘datahubs’ in house.

ViriCiti promises a 10% higher uptime, a 25% increase in range
and a 100% transparency of your data. Therefore companies
around the world use this system.

### The office

ViriCiti has around 20 employees. All departments work in the
same space. This allows for an open office culture. There is a
direct line between customer calls to feedback for developers.
ViriCiti also provides space to learn. A few interns currently
work here aswell as a few former interns.

### The products

ViriCiti's main product is the web application which let users view all of the live and historical data right in the browser. If an electric bus or truck can send out a paramater, a piece of data, ViriCiti will make sure you can view this live, perform analysis and generate reports on it.

ViriCiti also provides incident notifications through email and sms. A user can receive a notification when for instance a bus or truck has a low battery. This will help users keep track of their fleets.

ViriCiti has countless other, smaller, products to make sure this runs a smoothly as possible.

### My position within the company.

I am mainly the front-end developer at ViriCiti. I'm in charge of realising all the idea's for the front-end. I do have more than one role at ViriCiti because of it's smaller size. There is no visual or user experience design department. This is no problem because I can take on these roles because of my studies. During this internship I will also be in charge of native development. This is a lot of responsability that I'm more than willing to take on.

## The internship supervisor

I had two people supervising my internship. Simon Rijk supervised my internship for the general part while Sakif Surur supervised me with day to day stuff.

### Simon Rijk

Simon Rijk, my internship supervisor, is an Aerospace engineer
and ICT specialist from the Technical University of Delft. He
is one of the founders of ViriCiti and has been working in this
field for several years. Because of his years of experience in
IoT and programming he is able to provide guidance in finding
the right solutions for complex problems in programming.

He makes sure that the quality of the products and solutions are of a great standerd and will lead all major projects.

### Sakif Surur

Sakif Surur, developer at ViriCiti, is Web Developer from the
University of Amsterdam. He will help me with day-to-day
guidance. With his years of experience in web- and appdevelopment
he will be able to help me in the area of frontend
and app-development since the main assignment of the
internship is bulding a native app.

Sakif is involved in every project and will use his skills and knowledge to realize them and to optimize them.

## My job description

During the internship I took on four major roles. I had a lot of freedom and responsibility during this project. I worked very autonomous.

### Front-end/Native developer

I was in charge of building the actual app. For this I needed to use a popular Javascript front-end framework that is used to create native apps, React Native, to realize this. I was in charge of writing all the code to build the functionality and styles of the app.

### User Experience/Visual designer

I also was in charge of all the design work. I needed to sketch all the idea's to a low-fi prototype, design a hi-fi prototype and iterate over the user experience and visual design throughout the entire process of building the app.

### Back-end developer

I needed to build an server to hook my app up to and handle all the requests. To do this, I had to write an API to make requests to. This server would then make sure to get everything you requested. I also had to write some microservices to provide functionality. More on this later.

### Project manager

I managed this project all on my own. It was my responsibilty to make sure that the project was on track and everything was done in a structured and documented way.
